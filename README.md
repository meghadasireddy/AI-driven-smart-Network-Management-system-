With accelerating digital transformation, communication networks face unprecedented demands on reliability, low latency, and efficient data handling. Traditional network management techniques usually based on SNMP monitoring and manual configuration are usually inadequate in dynamically responding to variations in network load or faults. Such methods do not have the predictive ability to premanage network congestion or failures that can result in significant downtimes and degradation of performance. The proposed system, using machine learning algorithm Random Forest classifier, can identify and respond to network anomalies in real time, thus providing a responsive and efficient solution to meet the demands of modern communication systems.
